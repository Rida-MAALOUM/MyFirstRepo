Brief Introduction About Myself in the file
My name is Rida Maaloum, a passionate and motivated student with a strong interest in innovation, technology, and community-driven impact. 
I enjoy learning new skills, solving problems creatively, and contributing to projects that create real-world value.
My academic background has helped me develop both critical thinking and collaboration skills, which I continuously aim to improve.

Outside of studies, I’m actively involved in programs like ALX, where I engage in practical, hands-on learning and team-based challenges. 
I’m always eager to grow, connect with like-minded individuals, and work on initiatives that bring positive change.
